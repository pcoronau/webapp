# webapp
Webapp built during insight fellowship

This folder contains the necessary files to run UValue, my Dash Web App, which I hosted on Heroku: https://u-value.herokuapp.com.
The folder img contains the image I use on the app.
The main file is app.py
The files: Procfile.txt, requirements.txt and runtime.txt are files required by Heroku to run the app online.
